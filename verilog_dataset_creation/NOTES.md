TODO: More analysis of files collected needed! Find what the outliers/main problems are!
### Types of files we dont want:
- Long lists of definitions (e.g. data/full_repos/permissive/551163060/verilog/gl/user_proj_example.v , )
    - Maybe limit number of lines and/or characters for a single file?
    - Limit number of children of the same type
        - From python 150k: "keeping only programs that parse and have at most 30'000 nodes in the AST"
        - From codex: We filtered out files which were likely auto-generated, had average line length greater than 100, had maximum line length greater than 1000, or contained a small percentage of alphanumeric characters.
    - Examples:
        - data/full_repos/permissive/551163060/verilog/gl/user_proj_example.v
        - data/full_repos/permissive/19905110/fusesoc/orpsoc-cores/trunk/systems/de0_nano/rtl/verilog/wb_intercon.vh
        - data/full_repos/permissive/57886838/testcases/cad16_np3_case2/case11/cir1.v
        - data/full_repos/permissive/78109264/DeCam-Benchmarks-ISCAS-NAND-NOR-XOR/c2670/c2670-abcmap-fmt-8-randCam126-STD.v
        - data/full_repos/permissive/319767723/verilog/gl/mgmt_protect.v
- Very short files
    - Only comments
    - Only imports (?)
- Proprietary code (xilinx code has been found that is marked as confidential/proprietary, the repo is licensed as distributable and modifiable tho... 
    - Maybe search keywords like:
        - confidential
        - proprietary
        - all right reserved
        - all rights reserved
        - company names: (xilinx, altera, intel, cadence design)
        - Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)
        - intellectual property laws
    - Some notices include these keywords but are freely distributable:
        - example: data/full_repos/permissive/379676675/soc/dummy.v
        - keep whitelist keywords (some better than others):
            - apache
            - gnu
            - MIT License
            - free software
            - freely distributable (?)
            - Open Source Project
            - Open Hardware License
            - Solderpad Hardware License
            - netfpga
            - Free Software Foundation
            - JT12
            - JT_GNG
            - University (CHECK THESE INSTANCES MANUALLY, USUALLY DISTRIBUTABLE THO)
- Automatically generated files. 
    - Obvious examples: 
        - data/full_repos/permissive/314009583/hardware/tapeout_45/genesis_verif/test_pe_comp_unq1.sv
        - data/full_repos/permissive/495709021/NRPolarDecode/CRCGenerator_block.v
    - Non-obvious examples:
        - data/full_repos/permissive/355846505/tests/isa/rv32ui-p-lb.verilog
    - Probably most of the very long files are automatically generated...
    - blacklist keywords:
        - generated using
        - auto-generated
        - generated on
        - Cadence Genus
        - WIZARD-GENERATED
        - Yosys
        - Vivado(TM) HLS - High-Level Synthesis
        - Partial product generation
### Things to filter:
- license info (don't remove, some licenses need to stay where they are to be distributable! only remove maybe during pre processing at training time)
- long lists of print statements and/or definitions of small things like wires, etc (see files we don't want above)
- foreign characters (all non-standard (e.g. utf-8) enocoded data)
### Strings: 
- single-line: //
- multi-line: /* */
- For analysing comments, make sure to remove newlines, tabs, comment things
